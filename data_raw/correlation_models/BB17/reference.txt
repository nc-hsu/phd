The correlation model in this folder is that described in the paper:
Baker and Bradley (2017). Intensity Measure Correlations Observed in the NGA-West2 Database, and Dependence
of Correlations on Rupture and Site Parameters. Earthquake Spectra, Vol. 33 No. 1, 145-156

The data was downloaded on 06.01.2026 from the Supplementary Material provided with the Paper.

Note: There was a correction to the paper and the correlations have changed slightly. 
The new RSD595 correlations are:
- rhoPredictedPD_corrected.csv
- rhoDataPD_corrected.csv
- rhoPredicted_corrected.csv
- rhoData_corrected.csv

They were calculated using the matlab code provided by the authors of the original paper.
